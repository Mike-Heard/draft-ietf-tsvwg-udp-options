Implementation Experience with UDP Options
==========================================

UDP Options is a product of the IETF TSVWG working group. 
This document records topics related to experience with implementing and using UDP Options.

* Raffaele Zullo, Tom Jones, and Gorry Fairhurst, "Overcoming the sorrows of the young UDP Options", 
in 2020 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA), IEEE, 2020.

- Raffaele Zuulo did a partial implementation in a test tool using Android, which was ran on a range of platforms. 
It was used to verify network traversal of the options space (showing the method could be used 
across Internet paths with and without NAPT).
- Other related results were reported in:
    * https://ripe81.ripe.net/presentations/52-ripe81-matwg-zullo-udp-options-presentation.pdf
  
* Gorry Fairhurst, Tom Jones, Raffaele Zullo, “A Tale of Two Checksums”, MAPRG IETF 103, Bangkok.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-a-tale-of-two-checksums-tom-jones-00
- Presented an updated CCO method (draft-ietf-fairhurst-udp-options-cco-00).
This draft was finalled incorporated in UDP Options. 
The also talk provides measurement data and a commited patch to FreeBSD.

* Tom Jones reported an implementation in a fork of FreeBSD as the spec was being developed in TSVWG, 
at IETF 101, London.
https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/101/materials/slides-101-tsvwg-sessa-53-tom-jones-udp-options-implementation-02.
- Tom presented an update at TSVWG IETF 103 Bangkok. He did not implement the current fragmentation code, 
which was changed after his work. 

* Tom Jones reported experiments using a prototype of DPLPMTUD, using RES/REQ exchanges of udp-options, using draft -02.
(The wire format of these options has not changed since). 

* R. Mantu, M. Chiroiu, N. T, Apus, "Framework for evaluating TCP/IP Extensions in Communication Protocols", 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL Online ISSN 1841-9844, ISSN-L 1841-9836, 
Volume: 19, Issue: 2, Month: April, Year: 2024 Article Number: 4906, https://doi.org/10.15837/ijccc.2024.2.4906 
- Mantu et al independently developed an extendable packet annotation tool for IP, TCP and UDP options, 
based on NetfilterQueue with UDP Options support based on draft-ietf-tsvwg-udp-options-07.  
This tested 4x NOP; 4x NOP & CCO Timestamp Timestamp & CCO Experimental Experimental & CCO Unassigned Unassigned & CCO.
It concluded: with few exceptions, that all other providers [than google] have exceedingly high acceptance rates. We note that we did not encounter any cases in which UDP options were stripped or modified while also allowing the base packet to pass.
