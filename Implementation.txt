Implementation Experience with UDP Options
==========================================

UDP Options is a product of the IETF TSVWG working group. 
This document records topics related to experience with implementing and using UDop Options.

In 2020 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA), IEEE, 2020.

Raffaele Zuulo did a partial implementation in a test tool using Android, which he ran in a range of platforms. 
This was used to verify network traversal of the options space (showing the method could be used 
across Internet paths with and without NAPT).

Other related measurement campiagns were reported in:
    * https://ripe81.ripe.net/presentations/52-ripe81-matwg-zullo-udp-options-presentation.pdf
    * Presentation at MAPRG IETF 103, Bangkok

* Tom Jones reported an implementation in a fork of FreeBSD as the spec was being developed in TSVWG.
IETF 101 London.

* Tom presented an update at TSVWG IETF 103 Bangkok. He did not implement the current fragmentation code, 
which was changed after his work. 

* Tom Jones Tom reported experiments using a prototype of DPLPMTUD, using  RES/REQ  exchanges from -02.
(The wire format of which has not changed since).

Mantu et al independently developed an extendable packet annotation tool for IP, TCP and UDP options, 
based on NetfilterQueue with UDP Options support based on draft-ietf-tsvwg-udp-options-07.  
This tested 4x NOP; 4x NOP & CCO Timestamp Timestamp & CCO Experimental Experimental & CCO Unassigned Unassigned & CCO.
It concluded: with few exceptions, all other providers [than google] have exceedingly high acceptance rates. We note that we did not encounter any cases in which UDP options were stripped or modified while also allowing the base packet to pass.
